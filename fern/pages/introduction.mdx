## What is AgentMail?

AgentMail is an API platform for giving AI agents their own inboxes to send, recieve, and act upon emails. We handle the infrastructure so can focus on building email agents.

**Email agents** can:

- Have conversations with users in their inboxes
- Automate email-based workflows for enterprises
- Authenticate with third party applications
- Act as first-class users on the internet

## Why AgentMail?

Exisiting email infrastructure was built for humans. Legacy providers such as Gmail and Outlook:

- Lack API support for creating new inboxes
- Charge monthly subscriptions per inbox
- Impose restrictive rate and sending limits
- Offer poor developer experience

AgentMail is an API-first email provider that is designed for agents. Think of it like Gmail, but with:

- Programmatic inbox creation and management
- Usage-based pricing scaling with emails sent/received
- No restrictive rate/sending limits
- Real-time events over webhooks and websockets
- Simple API key auth â€“ no OAuth headaches
- Built-in API permissions and agent guardrails
- Semantic search across every inbox in organization
- Automatic labeling with user-defined prompts
- Structured data extraction
- And more on the way

Our customers use AgentMail for agent identity, authentication, and communication. To get started reach out to [contact@agentmail.cc](mailto:contact@agentmail.cc) for API keys and [support@agentmail.cc](mailto:support@agentmail.cc) for help.
