  <Accordion title="What is AgentMail?">
    AgentMail is an API-first email platform designed specifically for building
    AI agents that can communicate over email. While traditional email APIs are
    built for sending one-way notifications, AgentMail is built for two-way
    conversations, making it easy to create agents that can read, understand,
    and reply to emails in a thread, just like a human would.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is AgentMail different from services like SendGrid or Mailgun?">
    The key difference is our focus on **conversational agents**. Services like
    SendGrid are excellent for transactional emails (receipts, password resets)
    and marketing campaigns. These are done via a GUI. Resend is an API that is
    great to do those transactional emails as well. BUT AgentMail is built for
    the unique challenges of building autonomous agents, with first-class
    support for concepts like `Threads`, `Inboxes`, and `Attachments` to manage
    complex, stateful conversations over email.

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own custom domain to send emails?">
    Yes, absolutely! While you can get started instantly with an `@agentmail.to`
    inbox, we highly recommend setting up your own custom domain for production
    use. This improves deliverability and ensures emails come from your brand.
    You can find a complete guide [here](/guides/domains/custom-domains).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the best way to process incoming emails?">
    For production applications, **Webhooks are the recommended method**. They
    provide real-time notifications and are far more efficient than constantly
    polling the API for new messages. You can learn how to set them up in our
    [Webhooks Overview](/webhooks/overview).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I make sure I don't end up in spam?">
    Email deliverability is a complex topic. We go in depth in our [Email
    Deliverability best practices guide](/email-deliverability).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you have SDKs available?">
    Yes! We currently offer official SDKs for Node.js/TypeScript and Python to
    make integrating with AgentMail as easy as possible. You can find links and
    information in our [API reference](/api-reference).
