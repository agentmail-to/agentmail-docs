## What is SOC 2?

**SOC 2** is an attestation standard by **AICPA** (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) evaluating controls over:

1. **Security** - Protection against unauthorized access, both physical and logical
2. **Availability** - System accessibility and operational performance as committed
3. **Processing Integrity** - System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized
4. **Confidentiality** - Information designated as confidential is protected
5. **Privacy** - Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed per privacy commitments

### Report Types

- **Type I**: Verifies that security controls are properly **designed** at a point in time.
- **Type II**: Validates that controls **operate effectively** over a period (typically 6–12 months).

## Security Controls Implemented

The following controls have been audited and verified as part of our SOC 2 Type I compliance:

### Access Control

- Role-based access; **least privilege** enforced
- **MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication) for administrative access and sensitive operations
- Quarterly access reviews and revocation upon role change

### Encryption & Key Management

- **TLS 1.2+** for all service/API communications
- Data at rest encrypted using industry-standard ciphers
- Centralized **KMS** (Key Management Service) for key generation, rotation, and revocation
- **Encrypted point-in-time backups** with 30-day retention

See [Security Overview](https://agentmail.to/security) for more details.

### Email Authentication & Anti-Abuse

- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** configured across all sending domains
- Real-time scanning of inbound/outbound messages for malware/phishing
- IP-based **rate limiting** and behavioral abuse detection

See [Email Protocols](https://docs.agentmail.to/email-protocols) for technical details.

### Monitoring & Incident Response

- Centralized logging and anomaly detection with alerting
- Documented incident response process: detect → triage → contain → eradicate → recover → post-incident review
- Responsible disclosure channel for external security researchers

### Resilience, Backup & Recovery

- Daily encrypted backups with **30-day retention**
- Regular **restore tests** to validate RTO/RPO targets
- Multi-AZ/high-availability architecture for critical components

## SOC 2 Control Mapping

| Control Area | Implementation | SOC 2 Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access Control | RBAC, MFA, quarterly reviews | CC6.1–CC6.7 |
| Encryption & KMS | TLS 1.2+, at-rest encryption, key rotation | CC6.8–CC6.9 |
| Email Authentication | SPF/DKIM/DMARC, anti-abuse filters | CC7.1–CC7.4 |
| Threat Monitoring | Centralized logs, alerts, malware scanning | CC7.2–CC7.4 |
| Backup & Recovery | Daily backups, 30-day retention, restore tests | CC7.3 |
| Incident Response | Runbooks, post-mortems, disclosure program | CC7.4–CC7.5 |
| Workforce Security | Security training, NDAs, background checks | CC5.3–CC5.4 |

> The above mappings reflect our audited Type I controls and are maintained during the Type II observation period.

## Type II Certification Progress

AgentMail is currently in the **Type II observation period** (August 2025 - December 2025), during which an independent auditor is testing and validating that our security controls operate effectively over time.

### What's Being Tested

- **Continuous Operation**: Controls function consistently without gaps
- **Change Management**: Security maintained through system updates and changes
- **Evidence Collection**: Logs, tickets, training records, access reviews
- **Incident Handling**: Real-world response to security events (if any)

### Expected Completion

**Q1 2026** - Full SOC 2 Type II certification report from independent CPA firm

Type II certification provides the highest level of assurance that AgentMail's security controls are not only well-designed but also operate effectively over time.
