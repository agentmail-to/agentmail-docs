## What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It evaluates how organizations manage customer data based on five principles:

- **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access
- **Availability**: Systems are operational and accessible as committed
- **Processing Integrity**: Data processing is complete, accurate, and authorized
- **Confidentiality**: Information designated as confidential is protected
- **Privacy**: Personal information is collected, used, and retained appropriately

## What does this mean for you?

When you use AgentMail, you can trust that:

    controls, encryption, and continuous monitoring.

    Our policies and procedures align with established security frameworks. We
    don't just claim to be secure—we prove it through regular audits.

  <Accordion title="Our controls are continuously monitored">
    SOC 2 Type II certification means our controls were tested over an
    observation period, not just at a single point in time. This demonstrates
