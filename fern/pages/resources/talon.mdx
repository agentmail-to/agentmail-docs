description: "Learn how to use Talon to extract new content from email replies, removing quoted text and signatures with 93.8% accuracy."
---

## Why Talon?

Email threads accumulate quoted replies and signatures that clutter the actual content. When processing emails programmatically, you need just the new message, not the entire conversation history.

**Talon solves this problem** by extracting clean reply content through sophisticated pattern matching and structural analysis.

### Use Cases

- **AI Email Agents**: Extract new user messages without processing entire thread history
- **Email Automation**: Parse replies to identify actionable content
- **Thread Analysis**: Build conversation flows by isolating individual contributions
- **Inbox Management**: Process only new information from replies

## How Talon Works

Talon uses two complementary approaches depending on email format:

### Plain Text Processing (6-Stage Pipeline)

1. **Line Classification**: Assigns markers to each line ('t'=text, 'm'=quote marker, 's'=splitter, 'e'=empty)
2. **Pattern Matching**: Applies regex to marker sequences to identify quoted blocks
3. **Content Extraction**: Removes quoted lines and returns clean text

Recognizes patterns like:
- Standard quote markers (`>`)
- Reply headers ("On [date] [name] wrote:")
- Forward indicators ("-----Original Message-----")

### HTML Processing (8-Stage Pipeline)

1. **Structural Removal**: Directly removes known quotation elements (Gmail divs, blockquotes, Outlook markup)
2. **Checkpoint Fallback**: For non-standard HTML, maps elements to text lines, applies text patterns, removes corresponding HTML

### Two Processing Systems

**Quotation Removal** (Primary)
- Removes quoted replies from thread
- No initialization required
- Rule-based pattern matching

**Signature Extraction** (Optional)
- Removes email signatures
- Bruteforce method: ~90% accuracy, no setup
- ML method: Higher accuracy, requires `talon.init()`

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Talon">
    Install via pip with required workaround for Python 3.11+:

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```bash
    pip install talon
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Python 3.11+ Workaround">
    Required fix for cchardet dependency:

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```python
    # Import workaround BEFORE importing talon
    import sys
    import chardet
    sys.modules['cchardet'] = chardet

    # Now safe to import talon
    import talon
    from talon import quotations
    talon.init()  # Only needed for ML-based signature extraction
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    <Callout intent="warn">
      This workaround is **required** for Python 3.11+. Without it, you'll get import errors.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Reply Content">
    Basic usage for plain text and HTML:

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```python title="Plain Text"
    from talon import quotations

    email = """Great work on the project!

    On Mon, Apr 11, 2011 at 6:54 PM, Bob wrote:
    > Can you review the document?
    > Need feedback by Friday.
    """

    clean_reply = quotations.extract_from_plain(email)
    # Result: "Great work on the project!"
    ```

    ```python title="HTML"
    from talon import quotations

    html_email = """
    <html><body>
    <div>Thanks for the update!</div>
    <div class="gmail_quote">
      <div>On Mon, Alice wrote:</div>
      <blockquote>Original message here</blockquote>
    </div>
    </body></html>
    """

    clean_html = quotations.extract_from_html(html_email)
    # Returns: <html><body><div>Thanks for the update!</div></body></html>
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Signatures (Optional)">
    Remove email signatures using bruteforce method:

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```python
    from talon.signature.bruteforce import extract_signature

    message = """I agree with the proposal.

    Best regards,
    John Doe
    Senior Engineer
    john@company.com
    """

    body, signature = extract_signature(message)
    # body: "I agree with the proposal."
    # signature: "Best regards,\nJohn Doe\nSenior Engineer\njohn@company.com"
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    <Tip>
      Signature extraction is independent from quotation removal. Use them separately or combine them for complete email cleaning.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance & Accuracy

Talon has been tested on 64 real-world emails from various clients and languages.

### Test Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tests** | 64 emails |
| **Passed** | 60 (93.8%) |
| **Failed** | 4 (6.2%) |
| **Avg Processing Time** | 1.92ms |
| **Throughput** | 488.6 emails/second |
| **Min/Max Time** | 0.13ms - 21.55ms |

### Test Coverage

- **22 HTML emails**: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Mail.ru, Hotmail
- **42 plain text emails**: Various formats and reply styles
- **6+ languages**: English, Japanese, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, German
- **Mobile clients**: iPhone, Android "Sent from" signatures

### What Works Well

- Standard reply formats (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail): **98%+ accuracy**
- Quote markers (`>`) and splitter patterns: **100%**
- Email signatures: **90%+ with bruteforce, higher with ML**
- Multi-language replies: **Excellent**
- HTML blockquotes and known structures: **Perfect**

### Processing Time by Complexity

| Email Type | Avg Time | Complexity |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Simple text reply | 0.2-0.5ms | Low |
| HTML Gmail/Outlook | 2-4ms | Medium |
| Complex threads | 4-22ms | High |

### Speed vs Accuracy Tradeoff

| Library | Avg Processing Time | Accuracy | Best For |
|---------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| **Talon** | 1.92ms | 93.8% | Production systems needing HTML support |
| qutoequail | 0.96ms | ~85% | Moderate accuracy requirements |
| Custom regex | 0.1ms | ~70% | Simple plain text, speed critical |

**Key Insight**: Talon offers the best accuracy at reasonable speed. For most applications, 1.92ms is negligibleâ€”you can still process 488 emails per second.

## Known Limitations

Talon failed 4 out of 64 test cases. Here's what didn't work:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Failed Test Cases (4 total)">
    ### Test Case 1: Complex Email Thread with Signature (2.55ms)

    **Input**:
    ```text
    Thank you, Sonya Johnson.

    I have sent an invite for 10:30am Monday PDT (today). I
    hope you can join.

    Regards,

    Christopher Edwards

    ```

    **Expected Output**: First 8 lines only (up to "Christopher Edwards")

    **Talon's Output**: Returns entire email including quoted text starting with "On Mon, Jun 3..." and all "> quoted text"

    **Issue**: Signature placement before quotes confuses detection logic

    ---

    ### Test Case 2: Inline Responses (0.48ms)

    **Input**:
    ```text
    On Tue, Apr 29, 2014 at 4:22 PM, Example Dev <sugar@example.com> wrote:

    I will reply under this one

    >
    > okay?
    >

    and under this.

    >

    ```

    **Expected Output**: Just the inline responses ("I will reply under this one" and "and under this.")

    **Talon's Output**: Returns everything including "On Tue, Apr 29..." header and all quoted lines

    **Issue**: Interleaved inline responses not recognized as the reply pattern

    ---

    ### Test Case 3: Gmail Forward HTML (3.41ms)

    **Input**:
    ```html
    <html><head></head><body><div dir="ltr">test<div><br></div><div>blah</div>
    <div><br><div class="gmail_quote">---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>
    From: <b class="gmail_sendername">Foo Bar</b>
    <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:foo@bar.example">foo@bar.example</a>&gt;</span><br>
    Date: Thu, Mar 24, 2016 at 5:17 PM<br>
    Subject: The Subject<br>
    To: John Doe &lt;<a href="mailto:john@doe.example">john@doe.example</a>&gt;<br>
    <br><br><div dir="ltr">Some text<div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
    </div><br></div></div></body></html>
    ```

    **Expected Output**: Just "test" and "blah" (before the forward marker)

    **Talon's Output**: Includes "---------- Forwarded message ----------" and forwarded content

    **Issue**: HTML forward headers not removed by Gmail quote detection

    ---

    ### Test Case 4: Thunderbird Forward HTML (4.34ms)

    **Input**:
    ```html
    <html><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
    <p><br></p>
    <div class="moz-forward-container"><br><br>
    -------- Forwarded Message --------
    <table class="moz-email-headers-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr><th>Subject:</th><td>Re: Example subject</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Date:</th><td>Tue, 3 May 2016 14:54:27 +0200 (CEST)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>From:</th><td>John Doe &lt;johndoe@example.com&gt;</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br><br>
    <div>Dear John,</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>This is a test.</div>
    </div></body></html>
    ```

    **Expected Output**: Empty (no new content, just forward)

    **Talon's Output**: Includes "-------- Forwarded Message --------" and forwarded content

    **Issue**: Thunderbird's `moz-forward-container` class not recognized

    ---

    **Key Insight**: 3 of 4 failures are forwarded messages. Regular replies work with 98%+ accuracy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Success Examples">
    ### Example 1: Simple Gmail Reply (0.2ms)

    **Input**:
    ```text
    Awesome! I haven't had another problem with it.

    On Aug 22, 2011, at 7:37 PM, defunkt<reply@reply.github.com> wrote:

    To: John S. Greene
    Subject: [contact:106] John Greene

    A new comment has been added to the Contact named 'John Greene':

    I am replying to a comment.
    ```

    **Talon's Output**: `"Outlook with a reply directly above line"`

    **Processing Time**: 0.51ms

    **What Worked**: Outlook separator line (underscores) and "From:"/"Sent:" headers detected as splitter

    ---

    ### Example 3: HTML Outlook Reply (4.02ms)

    **Input**:
    ```html
    <html>
      <body>
        <div>Reply</div>
        <span id="OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION">
          <div>
            <span>From: </span>Bob &lt;<a href="mailto:bob@example.com">bob@example.com</a>&gt;<br>
            <span>Date: </span>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 18:54:39 -0700<br>
            <span>To: </span>Rob &lt;<a href="mailto:rob@example.com">rob@example.com</a>&gt;<br>
            <span>Subject: </span>Test<br>

          <div>Hi</div>
        </span>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Talon's Output**: `"Reply"`

    **Processing Time**: 4.02ms

    **What Worked**: Outlook's `OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION` span ID detected and removed structurally
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance vs Simpler Alternatives">
    **Tradeoff**: Talon is more comprehensive but slower than plain-text-only libraries

    - Talon: 1.92ms average (with HTML support)
    - email-reply-parser: 0.03ms average (plain text only)

    For production systems, 1.92ms average is negligible. Even at worst case (21.55ms), Talon is faster than most network requests.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forwarded Messages">
    As shown in test results, forwarded messages (especially HTML) are challenging:

    - Plain text forwards: Generally work well
    - HTML forwards: May retain forward headers
    - Workaround: Use plain text extraction or post-process to remove forward markers

## Best Practices

### When to Use Talon

**Use Talon when you need:**
- HTML email support (Gmail, Outlook web clients)
- Signature extraction capabilities
- Multi-language email processing
- High accuracy (93.8%) across diverse formats
- Production-ready email automation

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Processing plain text only and need maximum speed
- Working exclusively with forwarded messages
- Need minimal dependencies

### Error Handling

Always handle potential parsing failures:

```python
from talon import quotations

def safe_extract(email_body, is_html=False):
    try:
        if is_html:
            return quotations.extract_from_html(email_body)
        else:
            return quotations.extract_from_plain(email_body)
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to original message if extraction fails
        print(f"Talon extraction failed: {e}")
        return email_body
```

### Combining Quotation & Signature Removal

For complete email cleaning, apply both operations:

```python
from talon import quotations
from talon.signature.bruteforce import extract_signature

def clean_email(raw_email, is_html=False):
    # Step 1: Remove quotations
    if is_html:
        no_quotes = quotations.extract_from_html(raw_email)
    else:
        no_quotes = quotations.extract_from_plain(raw_email)

    # Step 2: Remove signature (works on text)
    if is_html:
        # Convert HTML to text first for signature extraction
        from talon import utils
        text = utils.html_tree_to_text(utils.html_fromstring(no_quotes))
        clean_text, sig = extract_signature(text)
        return clean_text
    else:
        clean_text, sig = extract_signature(no_quotes)
        return clean_text

# Usage
clean_content = clean_email(incoming_email, is_html=True)
```

### AgentMail Integration

Use Talon to process incoming webhook messages:

```python
from talon import quotations
import sys
import chardet
sys.modules['cchardet'] = chardet

def process_agentmail_webhook(webhook_data):
    """Process incoming AgentMail webhook with Talon extraction."""
    message = webhook_data['message']
    body = message['body']
    is_html = message.get('content_type') == 'text/html'

    # Extract clean reply
    if is_html:
        clean_reply = quotations.extract_from_html(body)
    else:
        clean_reply = quotations.extract_from_plain(body)

    # Now process only the new content
    return {
        'thread_id': message['thread_id'],
        'from': message['from'],
        'clean_content': clean_reply,
        'original_length': len(body),
        'cleaned_length': len(clean_reply)
    }
```

### Testing Recommendations

Always test with your specific email formats:

```python
# Create a test suite with your actual email patterns
test_emails = [
    "path/to/gmail_reply.html",
    "path/to/outlook_reply.txt",
    "path/to/forward.html"
]

for email_file in test_emails:
    with open(email_file) as f:
        content = f.read()
        result = quotations.extract_from(content)
        print(f"{email_file}: {len(result)} chars extracted")
```

<Tip>
  Test with real emails from your users' actual email clients. Talon's accuracy is based on diverse real-world samples, but your specific use case may have unique patterns.
</Tip>

## TypeScript Implementation (Coming Soon)

We're currently researching how to port Talon to TypeScript for native API integration. 
The Python implementation is fully functional and can be used via:
- Separate microservice
- Python subprocess calls
- REST API wrapper

Check back soon for TypeScript implementation updates.
