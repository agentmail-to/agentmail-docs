## What is a Draft?

A `Draft` is an unsent `Message`. It's a resource that allows your agent to prepare the contents of an email—including recipients, a subject, a body, and `Attachments`—without sending it immediately.

We know agent reliability is big these days--with `Drafts` you can have agents have ready-to-send emails and only with your permission it can send them off into the world.

`Drafts` are a key component for building advanced agent workflows. They enable:

- **Human-in-the-Loop Review:** An agent can create a `Draft` for a sensitive or important `Message`, which a human can then review and approve before it's sent.
- **Scheduled Sending:** Your agent can create a `Draft` and then have a separate process send it at a specific time, such as during business hours for the recipient.
- **Complex Composition:** For `Messages` that require multiple steps to build (e.g., fetching data from several sources, generating content), `Drafts` allow you to save the state of the email as it's being composed.

## The `Draft` Lifecycle

You can interact with `Drafts` throughout their lifecycle, from creation to the moment they are sent.

### 1. Create a `Draft`

This is the first step. You create a `Draft` in a specific `Inbox` that will eventually be the sender.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
# You'll need an inbox ID to create a draft in.

new_draft=client.inboxes.drafts.create(
    inbox_id="outbound@domain.com",
    to=["review-team@example.com"],
    subject="[NEEDS REVIEW] Agent's proposed response"
)

print(f"Draft created successfully with ID: {new_draft.draft_id}")

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
// You'll need an inbox ID to create a draft in.

const newDraft = await client.inboxes.drafts.create(
	"my_inbox@domain.com",
	{
		to: [
				"review-team@example.com"
			],
		subject: "[NEEDS REVIEW] Agent's proposed response"
	}
)

console.log(`Draft created successfully with ID: ${newDraft.id}`);
````

</CodeBlocks>

### 2. Get `Draft`

Once a `Draft` is created, you can retrieve it by its ID

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
# Get the draft
draft = client.inboxes.drafts.get(inbox_id = “my_inbox@domain.com”, draft_id = “draft_id_123”)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"

// Get the draft
const draft = await client.inboxes.drafts.get(
	"inbox_id",
	"draft_id_123"
)

````

</CodeBlocks>

### 3. Send a `Draft`

This is the final step that converts the `Draft` into a sent `Message`. Once sent, the `Draft` is deleted.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"

# This sends the draft and deletes it

sent_message = client.inboxes.drafts.send(inbox_id = 'my_inbox@domain.com', draft_id = 'draft_id_123')

print(f"Draft sent! New message ID: {sent_message.message_id}")

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"

const sentMessage = await client.inboxes.drafts.send('my_inbox@domain.com', 'draft_id_123');

console.log(`Draft sent! New message ID: ${sentMessage.message_id}`);
````

</CodeBlocks>

Note that now we access it by message_id now because now its a message!!

## Org-Wide `Draft` Management

Similar to `Threads`, you can list all `Drafts` across your entire `Organization`. This is perfect for building a central dashboard where a human supervisor can view, approve, or delete any `Draft` created by any agent in your fleet.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
# Get all drafts across the entire organization
all_drafts = client.drafts.list()

print(f"Found {all_drafts.count} drafts pending review.")

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
// Get all drafts across the entire organization
const allDrafts = await client.drafts.list();

console.log(`Found ${allDrafts.count} drafts pending review.`);
````

</CodeBlocks>
