## What is a Thread?

A `Thread` is an API resource that represents a single conversation. It acts as a container, grouping a series of related `Messages` together in chronological order, just like a conversation thread in a traditional email client.

`Threads` are created automatically. When your agent sends a `Message` that isn't a reply to a previous one, a new `Thread` is initiated. Any subsequent replies are automatically added to this same `Thread`, allowing your agent to easily maintain the context of a conversation over time.

## Querying `Threads`

While `Threads` are created implicitly, you can retrieve them in two powerful ways: scoped to a single `Inbox` or across your entire `Organization`.

### Listing `Threads` per `Inbox`

This is the standard way to retrieve all the conversations associated with a single agent or `Inbox`.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
# You'll need an inbox ID to list threads from.
inbox_id = "inbound-agent@agentmail.to"

# This retrieves all threads within the specified Inbox

inbox_threads = client.inboxes.threads.list(inbox_id=inbox_id)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
// You'll need an inbox ID to list threads from.
const inboxId = "inbound-agent@agentmail.to";

// This retrieves all threads within the specified Inbox
const inboxThreads = await client.inboxes.threads.list(inbound-agent@agentmail.to);

console.log(`Found ${inboxThreads.length} threads in Inbox ${inboxId}.`);
````

</CodeBlocks>

### Listing `Threads` Across an `Organization`

This is one of AgentMail's most powerful features. By omitting the `inbox_id`, you can retrieve a list of `Threads` from **every `Inbox`** in your `Organization`. This org-wide querying capability is essential for building:

- **Supervisor Agents:** An agent that monitors conversations from a fleet of other agents.
- **Analytics Dashboards:** Building something where you need visibility across all inboxes across the organization
- **Advanced Workflows:** Systems that can route or escalate conversations between different agents with different permissions.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
# By not providing an inbox_id, we get all threads in the organization
all_threads = client.threads.list()

print(f"Found {len(all_threads)} threads across the entire organization.")

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
// By not providing an inboxId, we get all threads in the organization
const allThreads = await client.threads.list();

console.log(`Found ${allThreads.length} threads across the entire organization.`);
````

</CodeBlocks>

<Callout title="Coming Soon: Org-Wide Semantic Search" intent="info">
  We are actively developing semantic search for the organization-wide thread
  listing endpoint. Soon, you'll be able to find `Threads` based on the meaning
  and concepts within the `Messages`, not just keywords.
</Callout>

### Getting a Single `Thread`

You can also retrieve a single `Thread` by its ID. This will return the `Thread` object, which typically contains a list of all its associated `Messages` and their ID's. A common workflow is listing the messages in a thread and calling the `messages.reply` method on the last one.

<CodeBlocks>
```python
thread_id = "thread_456def"

# This retrieves a single thread and its messages

thread = client.threads.get(
    thread_id="thread_id"
)

print(f"Retrieved thread {thread.id} with {len(thread.messages)} messages.")

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
const threadId = "thread_456def";

// This retrieves a single thread and its messages
const thread = await client.threads.get(
	"thread_id"
)

console.log(`Retrieved thread ${thread.id} with ${thread.messages.length} messages.`);
````

</CodeBlocks>
