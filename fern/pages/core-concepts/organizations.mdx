## What is an Organization?

An `Organization` is the top-level entity in AgentMail that acts as a container for all your resources. When you sign up for AgentMail, an organization is automatically created for you.

Your organization holds:
- **Inboxes**: All the email accounts your agents use
- **Domains**: Custom domains you've configured for sending emails
- **API Keys**: Credentials for programmatic access
- **Pods**: Groups of inboxes for organization

## Retrieving Your Organization

You can retrieve your organization details programmatically:

<CodeBlocks>

```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

# Initialize the client
client = AgentMail(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get your organization details
org = client.organizations.get()

print(f"Organization ID: {org.organization_id}")
print(f"Created at: {org.created_at}")
```

```typescript
import { AgentMailClient } from "agentmail";

// Initialize the client
const client = new AgentMailClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Get your organization details
const org = await client.organizations.get();

console.log(`Organization ID: ${org.organizationId}`);
console.log(`Created at: ${org.createdAt}`);
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Organization Response

The `get` endpoint returns the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `organization_id` | string | Unique identifier for your organization |
| `created_at` | datetime | When the organization was created |
| `updated_at` | datetime | When the organization was last updated |
