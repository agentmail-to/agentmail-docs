## What is an Organization?

An `Organization` is the top-level entity in AgentMail that acts as a container for all your resources. When you sign up for AgentMail, an organization is automatically created for you.

Your organization holds:
- **Inboxes**: All the email accounts your agents use
- **Domains**: Custom domains you've configured for sending emails
- **API Keys**: Credentials for programmatic access
- **Pods**: Groups of inboxes for organization

## Usage Limits

Each organization has configurable limits that control how many resources you can create:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `inbox_count` | Current number of inboxes in your organization |
| `domain_count` | Current number of domains configured |
| `inbox_limit` | Maximum number of inboxes allowed |
| `domain_limit` | Maximum number of domains allowed |

<Tip>
  Need higher limits? Contact us at [support@agentmail.cc](mailto:support@agentmail.cc) to discuss your requirements.

## Retrieving Your Organization

You can retrieve your organization details to check your current usage and limits:

<CodeBlocks>

```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

# Initialize the client
client = AgentMail(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get your organization details
org = client.organizations.get()

print(f"Organization ID: {org.organization_id}")
print(f"Inboxes: {org.inbox_count} / {org.inbox_limit or 'unlimited'}")
print(f"Domains: {org.domain_count} / {org.domain_limit or 'unlimited'}")
```

```typescript
import { AgentMailClient } from "agentmail";

// Initialize the client
const client = new AgentMailClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Get your organization details
const org = await client.organizations.get();

console.log(`Organization ID: ${org.organizationId}`);
console.log(`Inboxes: ${org.inboxCount} / ${org.inboxLimit ?? "unlimited"}`);
console.log(`Domains: ${org.domainCount} / ${org.domainLimit ?? "unlimited"}`);
```

</CodeBlocks>
