## What are `Attachments`?

An `Attachment` is a file that is associated with a `Message`. This can be anything from a PDF invoice to a CSV report or an image(though we don't recommend sending images in the first email sent. We go more into this in the [deliverability section](/deliverability)). Your agents can both send `Attachments` in outgoing `Messages` and process `Attachments` from incoming `Messages`.

## Sending `Attachments`

To send a file, you include it in an `Attachments` array when sending a `Message`. Each object in the array represents one file and must have a `content` property.

- **`content`** (required): The Base64 encoded content of your file.
- **`filename`** (optional): The name of the file (e.g., `invoice.pdf`).
- **`content_type`** (optional): The MIME type of the file (e.g., `application/pdf`).

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
import base64

# A simple text file for this example

file_content = "This is the content of our report."

# You must Base64 encode the file content before sending

encoded_content = base64.b64encode(file_content.encode()).decode()

sent_message = client.messages.send(
inbox_id="reports@agentmail.to",
to=["supervisor@example.com"],
subject="Q4 Financial Report",
text="Please see the attached report.",
attachments=[{
"content": encoded_content,
"filename": "Q4-report.txt",
"content_type": "text/plain"
}]
)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
// A simple text file for this example
const fileContent = "This is the content of our report.";
// You must Base64 encode the file content before sending
const encodedContent = Buffer.from(fileContent).toString("base64");

const sentMessage = await client.messages.send("reports@agentmail.to", {
  to: ["supervisor@example.com"],
  subject: "Q4 Financial Report",
  text: "Please see the attached report.",
  attachments: [{
    content: encodedContent,
    filename: "Q4-report.txt",
    contentType: "text/plain",
  }],
});
````

</CodeBlocks>

## Retrieving `Attachments`

To retrieve an `Attachment`, you first need its `attachment_id`. You can get this ID from the `attachments` array on a `Message` object. Once you have the ID, you can download the file.

The API response for getting an attachment is the raw file itself, which you can then save to disk or process in memory.

### From a Specific `Message`

If you know the `Message` an `Attachment` belongs to, you can retrieve it directly.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
inbox_id = "inbox_123"
message_id = "msg_456"
attachment_id = "attach_789" # From the message object

file_data = client.inboxes.messages.attachments.get(
inbox_id=inbox_id,
message_id=message_id,
attachment_id=attachment_id
)

# Now you can save the file

with open("downloaded_file.pdf", "wb") as f:
f.write(file_data)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
const inboxId = "inbox_123";
const messageId = "msg_456";
const attachmentId = "attach_789"; // From the message object

const fileData = await client.inboxes.messages.attachments.get(
  inboxId,
  messageId,
  attachmentId
);

// fileData is a Blob/Buffer that you can process
// For example, in Node.js:
// import fs from 'fs';
// fs.writeFileSync('downloaded_file.pdf', fileData);
````

</CodeBlocks>

### From a Specific `Thread`

Similarly, you can retrieve an `Attachment` if you know the `Thread` it's in, which can be more convenient for multi-message conversations.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
inbox_id = "inbox_123"
thread_id = "thread_abc"
attachment_id = "attach_789" # From a message within the thread

file_data = client.inboxes.threads.attachments.get(
inbox_id=inbox_id,
thread_id=thread_id,
attachment_id=attachment_id
)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript"
const inboxId = "inbox_123";
const threadId = "thread_abc";
const attachmentId = "attach_789"; // From a message within the thread

const fileData = await client.inboxes.threads.attachments.get(
  inboxId,
  threadId,
  attachmentId
);
````

</CodeBlocks>
