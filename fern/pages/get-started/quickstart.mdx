This guide will walk you through installing the AgentMail SDK, authenticating with your API key, and creating your first email inbox.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the AgentMail Console">
    First, you'll need to access the AgentMail Console to manage your account and API keys. Click the link below to get started.
    <Card
      title="Open AgentMail Console"
      icon="fa-solid fa-desktop"
      href="https://console.agentmail.to"
      target="_blank"
    />
    If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up directly from the console. Once you're logged in, you'll be able to manage your inboxes, view analytics, and create API keys.
  </Step>

{" "}

<Step title="Create an API Key">
  Now that you're in the console, you'll need to create an API key to
  authenticate your requests. Navigate to the API Keys section in your console
  dashboard. ![API Key Creation Screenshot](/assets/api-key-creation.png) Click
  "Create New API Key" and give it a descriptive name. Once created, copy the
  API key and store it securely. Create a `.env` file in your project's root
  directory and add your key to it. We recommend using environment variables to
  keep your keys secure.
</Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the AgentMail SDK using your preferred package manager. We'll also
    use a library to load the environment variable from the `.env` file.
    <CodeBlocks>
      ```bash title="Python"
      pip install agentmail python-dotenv
      ```

      ```bash title="Node"
      npm install agentmail dotenv
      ```
    </CodeBlocks>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an inbox and send an email">
    Now you're ready to make your first API call. Create a new file (e.g.,
    `quickstart.py` or `quickstart.ts`) and add the following code. This script
    will initialize the AgentMail client, create a new inbox, and then send a
    test email.
    <CodeBlocks>
      ```python title="Python"
      import os
      from dotenv import load_dotenv
      from agentmail import AgentMail

      # Load the API key from the .env file
      load_dotenv()
      api_key = os.getenv("AGENTMAIL_API_KEY")

      # Initialize the client
      client = AgentMail(api_key=api_key)

      # Create an inbox
      print("Creating inbox...")
      inbox = client.inboxes.create() # domain is optional
      print("Inbox created successfully!")
      print(inbox)

      ```

      ```typescript title="TypeScript"
      import { AgentMailClient } from "agentmail";
      import "dotenv/config"; // loads .env file

      async function main() {
        // Initialize the client
        const client = new AgentMailClient({
          apiKey: process.env.AGENTMAIL_API_KEY,
        });

        // Create an inbox
        console.log("Creating inbox...");
        const inbox = await client.inboxes.create(); // domain is optional
        console.log("Inbox created successfully!");
        console.log(inbox);

        // Send an email from the new inbox
        console.log("Sending email...");
        await client.inboxes.messages.send(inbox.inbox_id, {
          to: "your-email@example.com",
          subject: "Hello from AgentMail!",
          text: "This is my first email sent with the AgentMail API.",
        });
        console.log("Email sent successfully!");
      }

      main();
      ```
    </CodeBlocks>
    <Note>
      The `domain` parameter is optional. If not provided, AgentMail will
      use the default `@agentmail.to` domain. If you would like a custom domain, please <a href="https://agentmail.to/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upgrade to a paid plan</a>.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the code">
    Execute the script from your terminal.
    <CodeBlocks>
      ```bash title="Python"
      python quickstart.py
      ```

      ```bash title="Node"
      npx ts-node quickstart.ts
      ```
    </CodeBlocks>
    You should see the details of your newly created inbox printed to the
    console. Congratulations, you've successfully created your first AgentMail
    inbox!

  </Step>
