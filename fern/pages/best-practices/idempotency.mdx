## What is Idempotency?

In the context of an API, idempotency is the concept that making the same API request multiple times produces the same result as making it just once. If an idempotent `POST` request to create a resource is sent five times, it only creates the resource on the first call. The next four calls do nothing but return the result of that first successful call.

This is a critical feature for building robust, fault-tolerant systems. Network errors, timeouts, and client-side retries are inevitable. Without idempotency, these events could lead to unwanted duplicate resources, like creating multiple identical inboxes or webhooks.

## How AgentMail Handles Idempotency

AgentMail supports idempotency for all `create` operations via an optional `client_id` parameter.

When you provide a `client_id` with a `create` request, AgentMail checks if a request with that same `client_id` has already been successfully completed.

- **If it's the first time** we've seen this `client_id`, we process the request as normal, create the resource, and store the resulting resource `id` against your `client_id`.
- **If we have seen this `client_id` before**, we do _not_ re-process the request. Instead, we immediately return a `200 OK` response with the data from the _original_, successfully completed request.

This allows you to safely retry requests without the risk of creating duplicate data.

```python
# The first time this code is run, it creates a new inbox.
inbox = client.inboxes.create(
    username="idempotent-test",
    client_id="user-123-inbox-primary"
)
print(f"Created inbox: {inbox.id}")

# If you run this exact same code again, it will NOT create a second
# inbox. It will return the same inbox object from the first call.
inbox_again = client.inboxes.create(
    username="idempotent-test",
    client_id="user-123-inbox-primary"
)
print(f"Retrieved same inbox: {inbox_again.id}")
# The inbox.id will be identical in both calls.
```

## Best Practices for `client_id`

To use idempotency effectively, the `client_id` you generate must be unique and deterministic.

- **Deterministic:** The same logical resource on your end should always generate the same `client_id`. For example, a `client_id` for a user's primary inbox could be `inbox-for-user-{{USER_ID}}`.
- **Unique:** Do not reuse a `client_id` for creating different resources. A `client_id` used to create an inbox should not be used to create a webhook.

A common and highly effective pattern is to generate a UUID (like a `UUID v4`) on your client side for a resource you are about to create, save that UUID in your own database, and then use it as the `client_id` in the API call. This gives you a reliable key to use for any retries.
