description: "A step-by-step guide to building an AI-powered sales agent that uses WebSocket for real-time email processing without polling or webhooks."
---

## Overview

Learn how to build a real-time sales agent that processes emails instantly using WebSocket connections. Unlike webhook-based agents that require ngrok and public URLs, this WebSocket approach connects directly to AgentMail for true real-time processing with minimal setup.

This agent demonstrates a practical sales workflow: a manager delegates prospect outreach to the agent, which then handles the entire conversation autonomously while keeping the manager informed of key signals.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working sales agent that:

1. **Connects via WebSocket** for instant, real-time email processing (no webhooks or ngrok needed)
2. **Handles manager emails** by extracting prospect info and sending personalized outreach
3. **Processes prospect replies** with AI-powered, context-aware responses
4. **Detects prospect intent** (interested, not interested, or asking questions)
5. **Notifies the manager** when prospects show strong buying signals

Here's the workflow:

```
Manager sends email with prospect info
         ↓
    Agent extracts prospect email
         ↓
    Agent generates AI sales pitch → Sends to prospect
         ↓
    Agent confirms to manager
         ↓
    [Prospect replies]
         ↓
    Agent detects intent + generates AI response
         ↓
    If interested → Notifies manager
```

## WebSocket vs Webhook: Why WebSocket?

<Callout intent="info">
**Key Advantage:** WebSocket connections are simpler to set up and provide true real-time processing.

| Feature | Webhook Approach | WebSocket Approach |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Setup | Requires ngrok + public URL | No external tools needed |
| Architecture | Flask server + HTTP | Pure async Python |
| Latency | HTTP round-trip | Instant streaming |
| Firewall | Must expose port | Outbound only |

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<Callout intent="info">
**Required:**
- Python 3.11 or higher installed
- An [AgentMail account](https://console.agentmail.to) and API key
- An [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com) and API key
</Callout>

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create Project Directory

Create a new directory for your agent:

```bash
mkdir sales-agent-websocket
cd sales-agent-websocket
```

### Step 2: Create the Agent Code

Create a file named `main.py` and paste the following code:

### Step 3: Create Requirements File

Create a file named `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "sales-agent-websocket"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"

dependencies = [
    "agentmail>=0.0.19",
    "openai>=1.0.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
]
```

Or if you prefer `requirements.txt`:

```txt
agentmail>=0.0.19
openai>=1.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or with pyproject.toml
pip install .
```

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```env
# AgentMail Configuration
AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=your_agentmail_api_key_here

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Inbox Settings
INBOX_USERNAME=sales-agent
```

<Callout intent="info">
**Note:** Unlike webhook-based agents, you don't need ngrok or a public URL. The WebSocket connection is outbound-only, so it works behind firewalls without any port forwarding.

## Code Walkthrough

Let's understand how the agent works by breaking down the key components.

```

### 1. WebSocket Connection Setup

The core of this agent is the WebSocket connection:

```python
from agentmail import AsyncAgentMail
from agentmail.websockets.client import AsyncWebsocketsClient
from agentmail.websockets.types import Subscribe
from agentmail.websockets.types.subscribed import Subscribed
from agentmail.events.types.message_received_event import MessageReceivedEvent

# Initialize the async client
agentmail = AsyncAgentMail(api_key=os.getenv("AGENTMAIL_API_KEY"))

# Create WebSocket client using the agentmail client's wrapper
ws_client = AsyncWebsocketsClient(client_wrapper=agentmail._client_wrapper)

# Connect and subscribe
async with ws_client.connect() as socket:
    await socket.send_subscribe(Subscribe(inbox_ids=[inbox_id]))
```

**Key points:**
- `AsyncAgentMail` is the async version of the client
- `AsyncWebsocketsClient` manages the WebSocket connection
- `Subscribe` specifies which inboxes to monitor
- The connection is a context manager for automatic cleanup

### 2. Event Handling Loop

The agent uses an async iterator pattern to process events:

```python
async for event in socket:
    if isinstance(event, Subscribed):
        print(f"✓ Subscribed to: {event.inbox_ids}")

    elif isinstance(event, MessageReceivedEvent):
        await handle_new_email(event.message)
```

**Event types:**
- `Subscribed` - Confirmation that subscription was successful
- `MessageReceivedEvent` - A new email arrived in the inbox

This pattern is cleaner than callback-based approaches and integrates naturally with Python's async/await.

### 3. Email Processing Flow

The agent routes emails based on content:

```python
async def handle_new_email(message):
    # Extract fields from the message object
    inbox_id = message.inbox_id
    message_id = message.message_id
    thread_id = message.thread_id
    from_field = message.from_ or ""  # Note: SDK uses from_
    from_email = extract_email(from_field)
    subject = message.subject or ""
    body = message.text or ""

    # Route based on email content
    if is_from_manager(body):
        await handle_manager_email(inbox_id, message_id, from_email, subject, body)
    else:
        await handle_prospect_email(inbox_id, message_id, thread_id, from_email, subject, body)
```

**Email extraction helper:**

```python
def extract_email(from_field):
    """Extract email from 'Name <email@example.com>' format"""
    match = re.search(r'<(.+?)>', from_field)
    return match.group(1) if match else from_field
```

### 4. Manager Email Handler

When the manager sends an email with prospect info:

```python
async def handle_manager_email(inbox_id, message_id, from_email, subject, body):
    global manager_email
    manager_email = from_email  # Remember for notifications

    # Extract prospect email using regex
    prospect_email = extract_prospect_info(body)

    if not prospect_email:
        await reply_to_email(inbox_id, message_id, from_email,
            "I couldn't find a prospect email. Please include it.")
        return

    # Generate AI sales pitch
    sales_pitch = await get_ai_response(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Create a sales email based on: {body}"}],
        "You are a helpful sales agent. Generate a brief, professional email..."
    )

    # Send to prospect
    await send_email(inbox_id, prospect_email, f"Introduction: {subject}", sales_pitch)

    # Confirm to manager
    await reply_to_email(inbox_id, message_id, from_email,
        f"✓ Sent email to {prospect_email}.\n\nContent:\n{sales_pitch}")
```

### 5. Prospect Email Handler with Intent Detection

The agent tracks conversations and detects prospect intent:

```python
async def handle_prospect_email(inbox_id, message_id, thread_id, from_email, subject, body):
    # Track conversation history per thread
    if thread_id not in conversations:
        conversations[thread_id] = []
    conversations[thread_id].append({"role": "user", "content": body})

    # Detect intent with keyword matching
    intent_keywords = {
        'interested': ['interested', 'demo', 'meeting', 'tell me more'],
        'not_interested': ['not interested', 'no thank', 'maybe later'],
        'question': ['?', 'how', 'what', 'when', 'why']
    }

    intent = 'question'  # default
    for key, keywords in intent_keywords.items():
        if any(kw in body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            intent = key
            break

    # Generate contextual AI response using conversation history
    response = await get_ai_response(conversations[thread_id], system_prompt)

    # Reply to prospect
    await reply_to_email(inbox_id, message_id, from_email, response)

    # Notify manager of strong signals
    if manager_email and intent in ['interested', 'not_interested']:
        await send_email(inbox_id, manager_email, f"Update: {from_email}",
            f"Prospect is {intent}.\n\nTheir message:\n{body}")
```

### 6. AI Response Generation

The agent uses OpenAI for generating responses:

```python
async def get_ai_response(messages, system_prompt):
    try:
        response = await openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                *messages  # Include conversation history
            ],
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return "I apologize, but I encountered an error."
```

**Key points:**
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for fast, cost-effective responses
- Includes full conversation history for context
- Graceful error handling with fallback message

## Running the Agent

Start the agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see output like this:

```
Sales Agent starting...
Inbox: sales-agent@agentmail.to
✓ Connecting to AgentMail WebSocket...
✓ Connected! Listening for emails...

✓ Subscribed to: ['sales-agent@agentmail.to']
```

<Callout intent="success">
**Success!** Your agent is now running and listening for emails in real-time.

Leave this terminal window open - closing it will stop the agent.
</Callout>

## Testing Your Agent

Let's verify everything works with some test scenarios.

### Test Scenario 1: Manager Outreach Request

**Send this email from your personal email:**

```
To: sales-agent@agentmail.to
Subject: New lead - AI startup
Body: Please reach out to this prospect: john@techstartup.com
      They're interested in our API platform.
```

**Expected console output:**

```
============================================================
New email from: your-email@gmail.com
Subject: New lead - AI startup
============================================================

📧 Email from MANAGER: your-email@gmail.com
→ Extracted prospect email: john@techstartup.com
✓ Sent email to john@techstartup.com
✓ Sent reply to your-email@gmail.com
```

**You'll receive:** A confirmation email with the sales pitch that was sent.

### Test Scenario 2: Prospect Reply (Question)

**Have someone reply to the sales pitch:**

```
Subject: Re: Introduction - New lead - AI startup
Body: Hi, this looks interesting. How much does it cost?
```

**Expected console output:**

```
📧 Email from PROSPECT: john@techstartup.com
✓ Sent reply to john@techstartup.com
```

### Test Scenario 3: Prospect Shows Interest

**Prospect sends:**

```
Body: This sounds great! I'd love to schedule a demo.
```

**Expected console output:**

```
📧 Email from PROSPECT: john@techstartup.com
✓ Sent reply to john@techstartup.com
→ Notified manager about prospect's interested
```

**Manager receives:** An update email with the prospect's interest signal.

<Callout intent="success">
**It works!** The agent processed emails in real-time, generated AI responses, and notified you about the interested prospect.
</Callout>

## Customization

### Modifying Intent Detection

Update the `intent_keywords` dictionary in `handle_prospect_email()`:

```python
intent_keywords = {
    'interested': ['interested', 'demo', 'meeting', 'pricing', 'sign up'],
    'not_interested': ['not interested', 'unsubscribe', 'remove me'],
    'question': ['?', 'how', 'what', 'when', 'can you'],
    'urgent': ['urgent', 'asap', 'immediately']  # Add new intent
}
```

### Adjusting AI Prompts

Modify the system prompts in `handle_manager_email()` and `handle_prospect_email()`:

```python
system_prompt = """You are a sales agent for [Your Company].
Our product: [Description]
Pricing: [Tiers]
Always be helpful and professional. Keep responses under 100 words."""
```

### Adding More Inbox Subscriptions

Subscribe to multiple inboxes:

```python
await socket.send_subscribe(Subscribe(inbox_ids=[
    "sales-agent@agentmail.to",
    "support-agent@agentmail.to",
    "info@yourdomain.com"
]))
```
