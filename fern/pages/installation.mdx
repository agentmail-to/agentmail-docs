Welcome to the AgentMail Installation guide! This section will walk you through the process of setting up the AgentMail API/SDK in your project. While we are not yet integrated with package managers like npm or Yarn, you can still get started by manually adding AgentMail to your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AgentMail, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher
- **npm or Yarn**: Although direct integration is not available yet, having a package manager can help manage dependencies once AgentMail is available.
- **API Key**: You will need your unique API key to authenticate with AgentMail. You can obtain this by [requesting access](mailto:access@agentmail.com).

## Installation Steps

Since AgentMail is not yet available on npm or Yarn, follow these steps to manually add it to your project.

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. If not, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```
