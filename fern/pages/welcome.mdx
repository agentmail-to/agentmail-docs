<Tip title="Welcome to AgentMail!" icon="">
  We're excited to have you onboard!
</Tip>

AgentMail is a powerful API/SDK that enables AI Agents to create inboxes on the fly + send and recieve emails. This effectively allows agents to assume their own identity and communicate via a universal protocol(email) with resources on the internet, people, and even other agents.

Here you will find everything you will need to get started with AgentMail.

Reach out to [contact@agentmail.cc](mailto:contact@agentmail.cc) for API keys and [support@agentmail.cc](mailto:support@agentmail.cc) for help.
