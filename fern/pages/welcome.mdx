Welcome to the AgentMail API docs!

AgentMail is a powerful API/SDK that enables AI Agents to create inboxes on the fly + send and recieve emails. This effectively allows agents to assume their own identity and communicate via a universal protocol(email) with resources on the internet, people, and even other agents.

Here you will find everything you will need to get started with AgentMail. You can [use this site template](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi) as a starting point for your own API documentation.

## Getting Started

Here you'll find more information about how to get started, and engage with our community.
