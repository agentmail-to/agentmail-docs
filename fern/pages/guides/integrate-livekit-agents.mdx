## Overview

This guide walks you through building a voice assistant with real time email capabilites. We use the LiveKit Agents SDK to build the voice functionality.

## Prequisites

Follow the [LiveKit voice AI quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/) to build a simple voice assistant. In this guide we will extend the functionality to this assistant to email.

You should have a file named `agent.py` which we will modify.

## Setup

Install python packages

```shell
pip install agentmail agentmail-toolkit
```

Set environment variables

```env
AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=<Your AgentMail API key>
AGENTMAIL_USERNAME=<Choose a username for your agent's inbox>
```

## Code

To the `agent.py` file add the following imports

```python
import os
import asyncio

from agentmail import AgentMail, AsyncAgentMail, Subscribe, MessageReceived
from agentmail_toolkit.livekit import AgentMailToolkit
```

Then add the `EmailAssistant` class

```python
class EmailAssistant(Agent):
    inbox_id: str
    ws_task: asyncio.Task | None = None

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        client = AgentMail()

        # By setting the client_id the inbox is created only once.
        username = os.getenv("AGENTMAIL_USERNAME")
        inbox = client.inboxes.create(username=username, client_id=f"{username}-inbox")

        self.inbox_id = inbox.inbox_id

        super().__init__(
            instructions=f"""
            You are a helpful voice and email AI assistant. Your name is AgentMail. You can recieve emails at {self.inbox_id}. You can also send and reply to emails.
            When using email tools, use "{self.inbox_id}" as the inbox_id parameter. When writing emails, include "AgentMail" in the signature.
            Always speak in English.
            IMPORTANT: {self.inbox_id} is your inbox, not the user's inbox.
            """,
            # The AgentMail Toolkit has ready-to-go tools for LiveKit agents.
            tools=AgentMailToolkit(client=client).get_tools(
                [
                    "list_threads",
                    "get_thread",
                    "get_attachment",
                    "send_message",
                    "reply_to_message",
                ]
            ),
        )

    async def _websocket_task(self):
        # Open a websocket connection to AgentMail.
        async with AsyncAgentMail().websockets.connect() as socket:
            # Subscribe to events from the inbox.
            await socket.send_subscribe(Subscribe(inbox_ids=[self.inbox_id]))

            while True:
                data = await socket.recv()

                # If a message is received by the inbox, interrupt the current conversation and generate a reply.
                if isinstance(data, MessageReceived):
                    self.session.interrupt()

                    await self.session.generate_reply(
                        instructions=f"""Say "I've recieved an email" and then read the email.""",
                        user_input=data.message.model_dump_json(),
                    )

    # Open the websocket connection and generate a greeting when the agent enters the call.
    async def on_enter(self):
        self.ws_task = asyncio.create_task(self._websocket_task())

        await self.session.generate_reply(
            instructions=f"""In English, greet the user, introduce yourself as AgentMail, inform them that you can "recieve emails" at {self.inbox_id}, and offer your assistance.""",
            allow_interruptions=False,
        )

    # Close the websocket connection when the agent exits the call.
    async def on_exit(self):
        if self.ws_task:
            self.ws_task.cancel()
```

Finally update the `entrypoint` function

```python
await session.start(
    room=ctx.room,
    agent=EmailAssistant(),  # Replace Assistant with EmailAssistant.
    room_input_options=RoomInputOptions(
        noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.BVC()
    ),
)
```

## Thats It

Run your agent inside the terminal and send it an email

```shell
python agent.py console
```
