## Why Use a Custom Domain?

When you're deploying AI agents that send email at scale, deliverability and trust are paramount. While the default `@agentmail.to` domain is great for getting started, using your own custom domains is essential for production applications. It gives you control over your sending reputation and enables advanced strategies for high-volume outreach.

    Each domain builds its own sending reputation. By using your own domain, you
    control this reputation, which is the single most important factor in
    reaching the inbox.

  <Card title="Scale with Multiple Domains" icon="fa-solid fa-network-wired">
    For high-volume sending, register multiple domains (e.g., `mercor.com`,
    `usemercor.com`, `mercorapp.com`). Spreading email volume across them is a
    key strategy to maximize deliverability.

## Setting Up Your Custom Domain

Configuring your domain is a three-step process: add the domain via API, copy the provided records into your DNS provider, and wait for verification.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create Domain & Get DNS Records">

To begin, make an API request to the `POST /domains/{domain_id}` endpoint with your domain name. AgentMail will register your domain and immediately return the full set of DNS records required for verification.

The API response includes a `records` array. Each object in this array contains the precise `name`, `type`, `value`, and `priority` you'll need to add to your DNS provider.

The initial `status` of the domain will be `pending`. It will change to `verified` once all the records are correctly configured and detected.

</Step>

<Step title="2. Add Records to Your DNS Provider">
The process for adding records varies slightly between providers. The examples below assume you are configuring the root domain `domain.com`.

<Callout title="Configuring a Subdomain?">
  If you're using a subdomain (e.g., `payment.domain.com`), the instructions are
  the same, but you must PREPEND the subdomain to the record NAME VALUE. For
  example, a `_dmarc` record for `domain.com` becomes `_dmarc.payment` for
  `payment.domain.com`. For records on the subdomain itself (like an MX record
  for `payment.domain.com`), the name would simply be `payment`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS Route 53">
    In your hosted zone, click **"Create record"**.

    - **CNAME (DKIM):**
      - **Record name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey` for a `name` of `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey.domain.com`).
      - **Value:** Can directly copy paste the `value` from the API response (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}.dkim.amazonses.com`).

    </Frame>

    - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
      - **Record name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `_dmarc` for a `name` of `_dmarc.domain.com`, or `mail` for a `name` of `mail.domain.com`).
      - **Value:** Can copy paste the`value` from the API, ensuring it is enclosed in quotes.

    - **MX:**
      - **Record name:** Leave this field blank to apply the record to the root domain.
      - **Value:** This is critical. You must combine the `priority` and `value` from the API into a single string, separated by a space. For example: `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloudflare">
    In the dashboard (**DNS > Records**), click **"Add record"**.

    - **CNAME (DKIM):**
      - **Name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey`).
      - **Target:** Copy paste the `value` from the API response.

    - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
      - **Name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g. `_dmarc`).
      - **Content:** Copy paste the `value` from the API response.

    - **MX:**
      - **Name:** Enter `@` to apply the record to the root domain.
      - **Mail server:** Enter the `value` from the API.
      - **Priority:** Enter the `priority` from the API.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="3. Verify Your Domain">
Once you've added the records, AgentMail will automatically begin to verify them. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours.

You can poll the `GET /domains/{domain_id}` endpoint to check the status. Once all records are `verified`, the overall domain `status` will update to `verified`.

</Step>

## Troubleshooting Common DNS Issues

DNS can be tricky. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My DNS changes aren't showing up instantly">
    DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though it's often much faster. If
    it's been a while, double-check by hitting the `GET /domains/{domain_id}`
    endpoint to check the status. It will tell you exactly which records are
    configured correctly or missing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm seeing 'Too many SPF records' errors">
    A domain must have only **one** SPF record. If you're using other services that send email on your behalf (like a CRM), you need to merge their SPF policies with AgentMail's into a single record.

    An SPF record is a single line of text. It starts with `v=spf1` and ends with a mechanism like `~all` or `-all`. All your permitted senders go in the middle.

    **How to Merge:**

    1.  **Find your existing SPF record.** It will look something like this: `v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com ~all`
    2.  **Find AgentMail's SPF include.** This is `include:spf.agentmail.to`.
    3.  **Combine them.** Copy the `include` from AgentMail and place it into your existing record, right before the `~all` or `-all` part.

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```text title="Example: Merging SPF records"
    # Before
    v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com ~all

    # After
    v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com include:spf.agentmail.to ~all
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    Just keep adding `include:` mechanisms for each service you use. Remember to only have one `v=spf1` at the beginning and one `~all` or `-all` at the end.
