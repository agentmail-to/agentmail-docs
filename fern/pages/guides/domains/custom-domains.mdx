## Why Use a Custom Domain?

When you're deploying AI agents that send email at scale, deliverability and trust are paramount. While the default `@agentmail.to` domain is great for getting started, using your own custom domains is essential for production applications. It gives you control over your sending reputation and enables advanced strategies for high-volume outreach.

    Each domain builds its own sending reputation. By using your own domain, you
    control this reputation, which is the single most important factor in
    reaching the inbox.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale with Multiple Domains" icon="fa-solid fa-network-wired">
    For high-volume sending, register multiple domains (e.g., `mercor.com`,
    `usemercor.com`, `mercorapp.com`). Spreading email volume across them is a
    key strategy to maximize deliverability.

## Setting Up Your Custom Domain

Configuring your domain is a three-step process: add the domain via API, copy the provided records into your DNS provider, and wait for verification.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create Domain & Get DNS Records">

Choose your preferred method to create a domain and get the required DNS records. AgentMail will register your domain and immediately return the full set of DNS records required for verification.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console">
    Navigate to the [AgentMail Console](https://console.agentmail.to) and follow these steps:

    1. **Go to Domains Section**: Click on "Domains" in the left sidebar
    2. **Add New Domain**: Click "Add Domain" or "Create Domain" button
    3. **Enter Domain Name**: Type your domain name (e.g., `your-domain.com`)
    4. **Create Domain**: Click "Create" to register the domain

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="SDK">

    <CodeBlocks>
      ```bash title="cURL"
      curl -X POST https://api.agentmail.to/domains/your-domain.com \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      ```

      ```python title="Python"
      from agentmail import AgentMail

      client = AgentMail(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

      # Create domain with default settings
      domain = client.domains.create("your-domain.com")

      # Or with custom feedback forwarding
      domain = client.domains.create(
        "your-domain.com",
        feedback_enabled=False
      )

      print("Domain created:", domain)
      print("DNS Records:", domain.records)
      ```

      ```typescript title="TypeScript"
      import { AgentMailClient } from "agentmail";

      const client = new AgentMailClient({
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      });

      // Create domain with default settings
      const domain = await client.domains.create("your-domain.com");

      // Or with custom feedback forwarding
      const domain = await client.domains.create("your-domain.com", {
        feedback_enabled: false
      });

      console.log("Domain created:", domain);
      console.log("DNS Records:", domain.records);
      ```
    </CodeBlocks>

<Callout type="info" title="Idempotent Requests">
  You can make these requests idempotent by including a ```client_id```
  attribute in the request so we dont serve an error if you try and create a
  domain that has already been registered with us.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" title="Feedback Forwarding">
  By default, bounce and complaint notifications are sent to your domain. You
  can disable this by setting `feedback_enabled` to `false` in your request. If
  not specified it is default set to `true`
</Callout>

    The API response includes a `records` array. Each object in this array contains the precise `name`, `type`, `value`, and `priority` you'll need to add to your DNS provider.

    The initial `status` of the domain will be `pending`. It will change as you configure your domain and we verify it on our end.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="2. Add Records to Your DNS Provider">
The process for adding records varies slightly between providers. The examples below assume you are configuring records in the apex `domain.com` hosted zone. If you are using a subdomain make sure it is in the apex domain hosted zone.

### Option A: Upload BIND Zone File (Easiest)

A BIND zone file is a text file that contains DNS resource records in a standardized format. This approach allows you to bulk upload our records to your DNS provider without you needing to go down one by one.

**How to use the BIND zone file:**

**Step 1: Download the BIND zone file**

    After creating your domain in the AgentMail Console, click the "Download BIND Zone File" button to get the complete zone file.

    </Frame>
    4. Upload the downloaded BIND zone file as is

{" "}

<Warning type="warning" title="Important: Review Before Importing">
  Uploading a BIND zone file in Porkbun REPLACES the existing records you have.
  This is fine if this is a fresh domain you bought for the sake of sending
  email but if this is a domain that has other important records configured,
  consider adding [additional records
  manually](#option-b-add-individual-records).
</Warning>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" title="BIND Zone File Format">
  Check that all records (CNAME, TXT, MX) have been correctly imported in the
  console(the console will show in real time if we can find the records,
  typically within seconds).
</Callout>

### Option B: Add Individual Records

Below are detailed instructions for AWS Route53, CloudFlare, and Namecheap. The instructions vary depending on whether you're using the AgentMail Console or the API directly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Via Console">
    If you created your domain through the [AgentMail Console](https://console.agentmail.to), the DNS records are displayed in a simplified format that's ready for copy-paste into your DNS provider.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS Route 53">
        In your hosted zone, click **"Create record"**.

        - **CNAME (DKIM):**
          - **Record name:** Copy the **Name** value directly from the console (e.g., `abc123._domainkey`).
          - **Value:** Copy the **Value** from the console (e.g., `abc123.dkim.amazonses.com`).

        - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
          - **Record name:** Copy the **Name** value directly from the console (e.g., `_dmarc` or `mail`).
          - **Value:** Copy the **Value** from the console, ensuring it is enclosed in quotes.

        - **MX:**
          - **Record name:** Enter the value exactly as we return it, whether its `@` or the subdomain.
          - **Value:** Copy the **Value** from the console (e.g., `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).
          - **Priority:** Use the priority shown in the console (typically `10`).

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cloudflare">
        In the dashboard (**DNS > Records**), click **"Add record"**.

        - **CNAME (DKIM):**
          - **Name:** Copy the **Name** value directly from the console.
          - **Target:** Copy the **Value** from the console.

        - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
          - **Name:** Copy the **Name** value directly from the console.
          - **Content:** Copy the **Value** from the console.

        - **MX:**
          - **Name:** Enter `@` to apply the record to the root domain.
          - **Mail server:** Copy the **Value** from the console.
          - **Priority:** Use the priority shown in the console.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Callout type="info" title="Console Advantage">
      The console automatically formats DNS record names to be relative hostnames (without the full domain), making them ready for direct copy-paste into your DNS provider. No manual parsing required!
    </Callout>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Via API">
    If you're using the API directly, the DNS records are returned as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that require some manual parsing.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS Route 53">
        In your hosted zone, click **"Create record"**.

        - **CNAME (DKIM):**
          - **Record name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey` for a `name` of `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey.domain.com`).
          - **Value:** Can directly copy paste the `value` from the API response (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}.dkim.amazonses.com`).

        <Frame caption="Example of adding a CNAME record in Route 53. Notice that AWS already appends the root domain (agentmail.cc) to the end of the name value!">
          <img src="../../../assets/awsdomain.png" alt="AWS Route 53 Record Configuration" />
        </Frame>

        - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
          - **Record name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `_dmarc` for a `name` of `_dmarc.domain.com`, or `mail` for a `name` of `mail.domain.com`).
          - **Value:** Can copy paste the`value` from the API, ensuring it is enclosed in quotes.

        - **MX:**
          - **Record name:** Leave this field blank to apply the record to the root domain.
          - **Value:** This is critical. You must combine the `priority` and `value` from the API into a single string, separated by a space. For example: `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cloudflare">
        In the dashboard (**DNS > Records**), click **"Add record"**.

        - **CNAME (DKIM):**
          - **Name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g., `{random_letters_numbers}._domainkey`).
          - **Target:** Copy paste the `value` from the API response.

        - **TXT (DMARC/SPF):**
          - **Name:** Enter the part of the `name` before your root domain (e.g. `_dmarc`).
          - **Content:** Copy paste the `value` from the API response.

        - **MX:**
          - **Name:** Enter the part of the name before your root domain
          - **Mail server:** Enter the `value` from the API.
          - **Priority:** Enter the `priority` from the API.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="3. Verify Your Domain">
Once you've added the records, AgentMail automatically begins to check them. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours for your DNS changes to propagate across the internet.

Check your domain verification status in the [AgentMail Console](https://console.agentmail.to/dashboard/domains):

1. **Navigate to Domains**: Go to the "Domains" section in the left sidebar
2. **View Domain Status**: Find your domain in the list and check its status
3. **Monitor Progress**: The status will update automatically as verification progresses
4. **View Details**: Click on your domain to see detailed information about which records are verified

The status indicators will show you exactly where you are in the process:

- **`Not Started`**: You need to click the Verify Domain button to kick start the process
- **`Pending`**: You still need to add or fix your DNS records
- **`Invalid`**: Some of your records are misconfigured. Please verify you inputted them correctly.
- **`Failed`**: Your records are correct, but our servers need a bump. Please click the verify domain button in the console.
- **`Verifying`**: DNS records are correct, and we're authorizing the domain
- **`Verified`**: Domain is fully verified and ready for sending

## Troubleshooting Common DNS Issues

DNS can be tricky. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My DNS changes aren't showing up instantly">
    DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though it's often much faster. If
    it's been a while, click the verify domain button in the console which will trigger a reverification manually(DNS propagation can get stuck at times). 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm seeing 'Too many SPF records' errors">
    A domain must have only **one** SPF record. If you're using other services that send email on your behalf (like a CRM), you need to merge their SPF policies with AgentMail's into a single record.

    An SPF record is a single line of text. It starts with `v=spf1` and ends with a mechanism like `~all` or `-all`. All your permitted senders go in the middle.

    **How to Merge:**

    1.  **Find your existing SPF record.** It will look something like this: `v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com ~all`
    2.  **Find AgentMail's SPF include.** This is `include:spf.agentmail.to`.
    3.  **Combine them.** Copy the `include` from AgentMail and place it into your existing record, right before the `~all` or `-all` part.

    <CodeBlocks>
    ```text title="Example: Merging SPF records"
    # Before
    v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com ~all

    # After
    v=spf1 include:_spf.other-domain.com include:spf.agentmail.to ~all
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

    Just keep adding `include:` mechanisms for each service you use. Remember to only have one `v=spf1` at the beginning and one `~all` or `-all` at the end.
