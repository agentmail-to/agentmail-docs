This guide walks you through the complete, practical workflow of an agent having a conversation. While the `Core Concepts` pages detail the individual API calls, this guide shows you how to stitch them together to create a functional conversational loop.

## The Foundation: Sending HTML & Text

As a quick reminder from our `Messages` documentation, it's a critical best practice to always provide both an `html` and a `text` version of your email. This ensures readability on all email clients and significantly improves deliverability.

```python
# Always provide both html and text when possible
client.inboxes.messages.send(
    inbox_id="outreach@agentmail.to",
    to=["potential-customer@example.com"],
    subject="Following up",
    text="Hi Jane,\n\nThis is a plain-text version of our email.",
    html="<p>Hi Jane,</p><p>This is a <strong>rich HTML</strong> version of our email.</p>",
    labels=["outreach-campaign"]
)
```

## The Conversational Loop

A common task for an agent is to check for replies in an `Inbox` and then respond to them. While using `Webhooks` is the most efficient method for this, you can also build a simple polling mechanism.

Here's the step-by-step logic for a polling-based conversational agent.

<Steps>
    <Step title="1. Find a Thread that Needs a Reply">
        First, you need to identify which conversations have new messages that your agent hasn't responded to. A great way to manage this is with `Labels`. You can list `Threads` in a specific `Inbox` that have an `unreplied` `Label`.
        
        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        # Find all threads in this inbox that are marked as unreplied
        threads = client.threads.list(
            labels = ["unreplied"]
        )
        if not threads:
            print("No threads need a reply.")
        else:
            # Let's work on the first unreplied thread
            thread_to_reply_to = list(threads)[0]
        ```
        ```typescript
        // Find all threads in this inbox that are marked as unreplied
        const threads = await client.threads.list(
            {
                labels: [
                    "huh"
                ]
            }
        )

        if (threads.length === 0) {
            console.log("No threads need a reply.");
        } else {
            // Let's work on the first unreplied thread
            const threadToReplyTo = list(threads)[0];
        }
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
    <Step title="2. Get the Last Message ID from the Thread">
        To reply to a conversation, you need to reply to the *most recent message* in the `Thread`. You can get a specific `Thread` by its ID, which will contain a list of all its `Messages`. You'll then grab the ID of the last `Message` in that list.

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        # Get the full thread object to access its messages
        thread_details = client.threads.get(thread_to_reply_to.thread_id)

        # The last message in the list is the one we want to reply to
        last_message = thread_details.messages[-1]
        message_id_to_reply_to = last_message.message_id
        ```
        ```typescript
        // Get the full thread object to access its messages
        const threadDetails = await client.threads.get('thread_id');

        // The last message in the array is the one we want to reply to
        const lastMessage = threadDetails.messages[threadDetails.messages.length - 1];
        const messageIdToReplyTo = lastMessage.message_id;
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>
    <Step title="3. Send the Reply and Update Labels">
        Now that you have the `message_id` to reply to, you can send your agent's response. It's also a best practice to update the `Labels` on the original `Message` at the same time, removing the `unreplied` `Label` and adding a `replied` `Label` to prevent the agent from replying to the same message twice.

        <CodeBlocks>
        ```python
        # Send the reply
        client.inboxes.messages.reply(
            inbox_id="support@agentmail.to",
            message_id=message_id_to_reply_to,
            text="This is our agent's helpful reply!"
        )

        # Update the labels on the original message
        client.inboxes.messages.update(
            inbox_id="support@agentmail.to",
            message_id=message_id_to_reply_to,
            add_labels=["replied"],
            remove_labels=["unreplied"]
        )
        ```
        ```typescript
        // Send the reply
        await client.inboxes.messages.reply("support@agentmail.to", messageIdToReplyTo, {
            text: "This is our agent's helpful reply!",
        });

        // Update the labels on the original message
        await client.inboxes.messages.update("support@agentmail.to", messageIdToReplyTo, {
            addLabels: ["replied"],
            removeLabels: ["unreplied"],
        });
        ```
        </CodeBlocks>
    </Step>

</Steps>

<Callout intent="success" title="Real-Time Processing with Webhooks">
For production applications, polling is inefficient. The best way to handle incoming replies is to use `Webhooks`. This allows AgentMail to notify your agent instantly when a new `Message` arrives, so you can reply in real-time.
