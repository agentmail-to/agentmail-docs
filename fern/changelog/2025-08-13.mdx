## Summary

We're excited to introduce **Metrics Endpoints** - two new powerful endpoints that give you deep insights into your email deliverability and agent performance. Track critical events like bounces, deliveries, rejections, and complaints with detailed timestamps.

### What's new?

New endpoints:

- `GET /metrics` - Get comprehensive metrics across all your inboxes
- `GET /inboxes/{inbox_id}/metrics` - Get metrics for a specific inbox

Build smarter agents that monitor their own bounce rates, optimize send timing, and automatically adjust behavior based on deliverability metrics. This unlocks exciting possibilities for self-optimizing agents that can pause campaigns when performance drops or implement intelligent retry strategies.
