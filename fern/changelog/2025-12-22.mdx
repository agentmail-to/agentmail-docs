## Summary

**Webhooks & Events** – receive email and domain events via HTTP callbacks. Subscribe to message lifecycle events (received, sent, delivered, bounced, complained, rejected) and domain verification. Use Svix headers for verification and filter by inbox or pod. Perfect for agents that need reliable, async notifications without keeping a WebSocket open.

### What's new?

**Webhook events:**
- `message.received` - New inbound email
- `message.sent` - Outbound message sent
- `message.delivered` - Delivery confirmed
- `message.bounced` - Bounce (with type and recipients)
- `message.complained` - Spam complaint
- `message.rejected` - Rejection (e.g. validation)
- `domain.verified` - Domain verification succeeded

**Delivery & verification:**
- Svix-style headers: `svix-id`, `svix-signature`, `svix-timestamp` for verification
- Filter by inbox or pod (up to 10 per webhook)
- Payloads include inbox_id, thread_id, message_id, timestamps, and event-specific data

### Use cases

Build agents that:
- React to new emails, bounces, and complaints via HTTP
- Sync email state to your database or queue
- Trigger workflows on domain verification
- Verify webhook signatures for security

<CodeBlock language="python">
```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

client = AgentMail(api_key="your-api-key")

# in your webhook handler: verify signature and handle event
# (use Svix or the raw headers for verification)
def handle_webhook(request):
    event_id = request.headers.get("svix-id")
    signature = request.headers.get("svix-signature")
    payload = request.json()
    # verify signature, then:
    if payload.get("event_type") == "message.received":
        message = payload.get("message")
        # process new email
    elif payload.get("event_type") == "domain.verified":
        domain = payload.get("domain")
        # domain is verified
```
