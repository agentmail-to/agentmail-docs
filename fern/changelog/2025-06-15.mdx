## Summary

Introducing **Pods** - team collaboration spaces for AgentMail. Share inboxes, domains, and resources across your organization while maintaining granular control. Perfect for teams building multi-agent email systems that need organized resource management.

### What's new?

**New endpoints:**
- `POST /pods` - Create a new pod (team workspace)
- `GET /pods` - List all pods in your organization
- `GET /pods/{pod_id}` - Get pod details
- `DELETE /pods/{pod_id}` - Delete a pod
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/inboxes` - Create inbox within a pod
- `POST /pods/{pod_id}/domains` - Add custom domain to a pod
- `GET /pods/{pod_id}/threads` - List threads within a pod
- `GET /pods/{pod_id}/metrics` - Get metrics for a pod

**Pod features:**
- Shared inbox access across team members
- Per-pod domain configuration
- Isolated metrics and analytics per pod
- Organized resource hierarchy

### Use cases

Build systems where:
- Multiple agents share email infrastructure
- Different teams manage their own inboxes independently
- Resources are organized by department or project
- Analytics are tracked per team workspace
- Billing and usage can be attributed to specific teams

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python"
from agentmail import AgentMail

client = AgentMail(api_key="your-api-key")

# create a pod for your sales team
pod = client.pods.create(
    name="Sales Team",
    description="Shared resources for sales agents"
)

# create an inbox in the pod
inbox = client.pods.inboxes.create(
    pod_id=pod.pod_id,
    inbox_id="sales@example.com"
)

# list all pods
pods = client.pods.list()
for pod in pods.pods:
    print(f"Pod: {pod.name} ({len(pod.inbox_ids)} inboxes)")
```

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { AgentMail } from "agentmail";

const client = new AgentMail({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

// create a pod for your sales team
const pod = await client.pods.create({
  name: "Sales Team",
  description: "Shared resources for sales agents",
});

// create an inbox in the pod
await client.pods.inboxes.create(pod.podId, "sales@example.com");

// list all pods
const { pods } = await client.pods.list();
for (const p of pods) {
  console.log(`Pod: ${p.name} (${p.inboxIds?.length ?? 0} inboxes)`);
}
```
