## Summary

Introducing **WebSocket Streaming** - receive email events in real-time as they happen. Build reactive agents that respond instantly to new messages, deliveries, and bounces without polling. Perfect for building interactive, event-driven email experiences.

### What's new?

**WebSocket endpoint:**
- `wss://ws.agentmail.to/v0` - Real-time event streaming

**Events streamed:**
- `message.received` - New inbound email detected
- `message.sent` - Outbound email sent successfully
- `message.delivered` - Delivery confirmed by recipient server
- `message.bounced` - Bounce detected (permanent or temporary)
- `message.complained` - Spam complaint received

**Connection features:**
- JWT-based authentication for secure connections
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Event filtering by inbox for targeted subscriptions
- Low-latency delivery (under 100ms typical)
- Support for thousands of concurrent connections

### Use cases

Build agents that:
- Respond to emails within seconds of receipt
- Monitor deliverability in real-time across all inboxes
- Trigger workflows instantly on specific events
- Build interactive conversational email experiences
- Scale to handle high-volume email operations
- React to bounces and complaints immediately

<CodeBlock language="python">
```python
from agentmail import AgentMail

client = AgentMail(api_key="your-api-key")

# subscribe to events for an inbox
async with client.websockets.subscribe(
    inbox_id="support@example.com"
) as ws:
    async for event in ws:
        if event.type == "message.received":
            print(f"New email from: {event.data.from_}")
            
            # process and respond immediately
            response = await generate_response(event.data.text)
            
            # reply instantly  
            await client.messages.reply(
                message_id=event.data.message_id,
                text=response
            )
```
